- Other corpora for DE-POS and DE-NER
	- Mannheim, google books, ...

- check to normalize/scale each component vector
	to unit length (compute length of vector, and then divide each component)
	I think I for got it 
	-> I am doing it now on complete feature vector in 
		trainer.ProblemInstance.createProblemInstanceFromWindow(Window)
	-> try it on relevant component feature!
	
- other shape features
	- cf. LiblinearNER.txt

- use other word embedding -> word2vec -> 
	but actually only used in NER -> so check, whether really usable
	maybe better clustering or other co-occurrence  models (WebQA?)

-	POS tags as feature for NER
	- how can I define a kind of pipeline model for GNT ?

- NER-lexikons
	- could be done by defining a NE-type-based feature similar to cluster-ID
	- but using dictionary lookup 
	- I could use a class OTHR for all words not covered by NE-lists
	
	- distant supervision using NER-lists
		- in principle: automatically tagged corpus PLUS some verification heuristics/context
	
	-> problem for both: ambiguity of NE-type in context
	- REALLY -> I could run NEMEXF or dtree-based tagger to get longest matching trees PLUS threshold
	
- character and other embeddings

- run GNT with suffix AND ngram by concatenating both into one file
	- DONE -> errors when concatenation -> I forgot to sort again after adding indices in 
		features.WordSuffixFeatureFactory.getAllKnownSubstringsForWord(String)
		
- compute all prefixes AND eventually combine with suffixes
	- or use as separate feature

- Interface to TORCH

***
Feature learning:
- Idea: extract POS/NER dictionary of tagged tokens or sequences from training file
	- without any (?) preprocessing of token spelling
- Apply dictionary on training file
	- should re-cover training file
	- analyze positive matches, partial matches and negative matches
- Extract possible feature functions
	- it is also a learning approach
- Apply extracted feature functions in supervised way

- Could also be used with NemexA
- Could also use specific learning approach for this
	- evolutionary programming
	- reinforcement learning
	- function learning

***
Additional applications:
- GNT also for chunking
	- should be very simple, but would eventually need POS tagging

- GNT for semantic role labeling/tagging

- GNT for relation extraction
	- maybe use a specific BIO-like annotation schema
	- check semantic role annotation
	
- GNT for morphological tagging
	- combine POS and MORPH tags

***
For software package:
- create property file
- save and move it to model file folder
- add FLORS accuracy to evaluation script
- create input file for TORCH
- generated compressed folder of all data that is necessary for tagging
- define feature instances ala ClearNLP via XML
-> how to integrate feature extraction approach dynamically ?

- define logger
- define parallel processing
