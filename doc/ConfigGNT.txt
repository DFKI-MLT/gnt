Define config file:
	- specify corpus files:
		taggerName: string
		trainingLabeledData = list of fileNames // For all: use file extension !
		devLabeledData = list of fileNames
		testLabeledData	= list of fileNames
		trainingUnLabeledData = list of fileNames
		devUnLabeledData = list of fileNames
		tesUntLabeledData	= list of fileNames

-> I think it is better to create these names from devLabeledData & testLabeledData:
		devEvalFile = single file
		testEvalFile = single file
	-> define list which is order consistent to devel/test files

Define taggerName specific config files	
		
For GNTrainer:
- provide property file
- set corpus as argument and pass further to relevant calls, so that Corpus object is not done by others
-> DONE

For GNTagger:
- create eval file names from test/devel file names as part of Corpus.java
- add Corpus.java then to GNTagger

When done, adapt caller main.GNT

STATUS:
- defined props file for EN POS -> taggerName ENPOS
- define class propertiesHandler
- adapt Corpus file:
	- create eval files based on available labeled devel and test files
