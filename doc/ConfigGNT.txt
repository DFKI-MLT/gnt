For GNTrainer:
- provide property file
- set corpus as argument and pass further to relevant calls, so that Corpus object is not done by others
-> DONE

When done, adapt caller main.GNT -> DONE

Strip off .conll file extension from labeled files
Strip off .src from source files
-> DONE

when corpus is defined, also CallProcessor
to create unlabeled data from labeled data
-> trainer.GNTrainer.GNTrainer(ModelInfo, GNTProperties)
-> DONE

hard-wired tagger names in corpus.CorpusProcessor.nerTokenToString(String[], int)

Call of trainer and tagger only depends now on config file
-> make simpler call, e.g., only define config files, and then call them
-> test.TrainPosTagger.main(String[])
-> test.RunPosTagger.main(String[])
