Goal is to compute all lower-case suffixes from a training set of words.
 * For suffix s, we set the dimension corresponding to s in f_suffix(w) to 1 if lowercased w ends in s 
 * and to 0 otherwise. Note that w is a suffix of itself.
 * In FLORS: 91,161 suffix features from PTB - I guess - and PTB as about 32.500 words.
 * It is unclear how FLORS define words from which suffixes should be created

I currently use only labeled training data:
	"/Users/gune00/data/MLDP/english/english-train-sents.txt"



I try to compute suffixes only from words, so filter out
- number expressions -> DONE
- multi-character string like '', G-7

Current result when using PTB version three without filter: 
 	#word: 32491 #suffixes: 98358
 	
With number filter: #word: 28481 #suffixes: 91144


Lower dimensions:

in previous paper, FLORS uses only 100 highest ranked suffixes
-> TEST this as well

- can also use other kinds of suffixes, e.g., for German just Morphix tree
