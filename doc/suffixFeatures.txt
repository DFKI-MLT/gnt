Goal is to compute all lower-case suffixes from a training set of words.
 * For suffix s, we set the dimension corresponding to s in f_suffix(w) to 1 if lowercased w ends in s 
 * and to 0 otherwise. Note that w is a suffix of itself.
 * In FLORS: 91,161 suffix features from PTB - I guess - and PTB has about 32.500 words.
 
 
 It is unclear how FLORS defines words from which suffixes should be created
-> for that reason I am using all tokens



I currently use only labeled training data:
- "/Users/gune00/data/MLDP/english/english-train-sents.txt"
	
- since suffix features are binary, only those which are seen in training can be used for learning
- so unlabeled data is not useful all suffixes from training


Lower dimensions:

in previous paper, FLORS uses only 100 highest ranked suffixes
-> TEST this as well

- can also use other kinds of suffixes, e.g., for German just Morphix tree
