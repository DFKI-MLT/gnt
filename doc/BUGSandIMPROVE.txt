- when zipping config file, then windowSize does not change
-> DONE: do copying after GNTrainer has been created

- when integrating brown clusters -> binary string must be mapped to integer 
-> within features.WordClusterFeatureFactory.getLiblinearIndex(String)


NER:
prediction of syntactically wrong labels, e.g., 

5 Ago/La I-OTH I-OTH
6 Fiesta I-OTH I-PER

-> I-PER is NOT possible -> sequential constraints necessary
-> at least one could do a post-process to correct it automatically

Similar case:

zu O O
21 Sometime B-OTH O
22 Ago I-OTH I-OTH

or

Die O O
2 St B-LOC O
3 . I-LOC I-LOC
4 Nikolauskapelle I-LOC I-LOC

-> problem here: how to define start of B-OTH or O

NE-derivations:
for German needs token-splitting, e.g.,

4 Hamiltonoperator B-PERpart O

-> split into Hamilton-operator
