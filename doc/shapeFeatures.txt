Shape features:
	Use Berkely parser word features.
	Each word is mapped to 16 bit string indicating ENGLISH orthography
	on WSJ: yields 50 different signatures (bit string instances).
	This gives 50 different shape features.

I currently use only labeled training data:
	"/Users/gune00/data/MLDP/english/english-train-sents.txt"

-> use all tokens from 
	-> I also create 50 different signatures
	-> NOTE: need to distinguish whether word is in 0 or 1 sentence position
	
Shape features are language and domain specific
