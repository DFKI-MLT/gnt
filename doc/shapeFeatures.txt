Shape features:
	Use Berkely parser word features.
	Each word is mapped to 16 bit string indicating ENGLISH orthography
	on WSJ: yields 50 different signatures (bit string instances).
	This gives 50 different shape features.

I currently use only labeled training data:
	"/Users/gune00/data/MLDP/english/english-train-sents.txt"
	-> use all tokens from it:
	-> I also create 50 different signatures
	-> NOTE: need to distinguish whether word is in 0 or 1 sentence position

-> New training version ptb3-training: 52 shapes
	
If word cannot be mapped to one of the learned shape features, then its shape list is empty.
Which means that the feataure is actually not available for that work.
This works, because shape feature lists and suffix feature lists are dynamic in length.
	
Shape features are language and domain specific
