15.9.2015:

- find error with missing signature
	- solved -> 
	  features.WordFeatures.fillShapeFeatures(String, int, Alphabet, boolean) does return an empty shape list (instead of NULL)

- use model file and label map file as parameter
	- solved -> define a class ModelInfo() and use it in trainer and tagger

- define evaluation method
	- done as part of tagger
	- I am using the original conll token and the predicted labels
	- and construct a version which consistent with conlleval

- check which tool for evaluation
	the one here: /Users/gune00/data/conll/conll03-NER/bin
	can also be used for NER
	
16.9.2015:

- define a single place for major resources
	resource/data
	resource/alphabet
	resource/modelfiles
	
- define main function to be used by exectuable
- define proberty class, so that tagger can be called from jar file also on unix machine
- define logger

- train larger models for MDP and FLORS
