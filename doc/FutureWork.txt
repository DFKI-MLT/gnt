NER - soon test GNT for NER:

October, 15th, 2015:

Integration of cluster in training and testing:
	- corpus see: /Users/gune00/data/Marmot/Word

- instead of suffix use trigrams -> is this similar to NemexA?

- more testing of liblinear itself ?

More unsupervised

Parallel processing

Morphological tagging:
-> with the help of the dictionaries in /Users/gune00/data/Marmot/Word

Can I use it as a generic tagging tool
- opinion mining ?
- other machine learning tools?



THINK: about distributed vector representations
	- currently, they are used for representing words
	- the vectors are build on basis of indicator words, which define the dimension, i.e., the vector space
