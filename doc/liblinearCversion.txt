January, 2016:

- Create LibLinear Input file, so that Cversion can be called
	- here is  the place of the GNTagger: tagger.GNTagger.constructProblemAndTag(boolean, boolean)
	- and for the trainer trainer.TrainerInMem.constructProblem(boolean, boolean)
	- I think, I define a writer method for trainer.ProblemInstance, which
		- is called for the current feature vector and receives the label and the writerBuffer
		- called it right after trainer.ProblemInstance.createProblemInstanceFromWindow(Window)
		- in training mode: also store label
		- in tagging mode: do not store label -> I think: can be used because it will be ignore in predict mode
		
- liblinear version:
	/Users/gune00/dfki/src/liblinear-2.1
	compilation works:
	called it 
	cross-validation: 	./train -v 10 heart_scale 
	create model file: 	./train heart_scale heart_model
	prediction:			./predict heart_scale_t heart_model label-outputs.txt
