October, 2015:

- using windowSize=1 hurts !
- using windowSize=3 neutral

- changes in suffix list does not improve either

-> it seems that only dimension around 50 brings something
-> also Turian et al. 2010 only uzse 50-dims for their word embedding stuff

-> try out better unknown word features

-> Acrually, it is unclear, whether GNT feature are usable for NER
-> check again paper from Tkachenko & Simanovsky

New possible features:

POS

previous predictions

prefixes

smaller suffixes/prefixes

genrealization of number/date expressions

context elements without certain features

Anyway: 
I script that could perform runs for a number of settings would be helpful
