October, 2015:

- using windowSize=1 hurts !
- using windowSize=3 neutral

- changes in suffix list does not improve either

-> it seems that only dimension around 50 brings something
-> also Turian et al. 2010 only use 50-dims for their word embedding stuff

-> try out better unknown word features

-> Actually, it is unclear, whether GNT features are usable for NER
-> check again paper from Tkachenko & Simanovsky

So, actually, what do I use:

I use this for both EN and DE

-	normalized text: lower case
-	window size: 2
-	no distributed word features or 50 dim indicator words
-	shape feature methods from POS applied on training
-	all suffix features from training
-	1000 clusterIDs from Marmot
	- NOTE: Marmot cluserID are based on digit-normalized wiki-dumps

OBACHT:
- ich hatte vergessen, test unlabeled data zu laden, was dazu führt, dass ich viele unknown word habe
	wenn ich distributed vector baue -> das hat zu Verlusten geführt
- Now, i get better results again, but missing 1% in case of eng-testb.conll
-> Now, the differences with previous tests is that I now use all sentences from unlabeded data, not only the first 1000
-> trie again with fewer unlabeled data
	- not using unlabeled large corpus PTB
	- NEXT: try out: load only 1000
-> THUS: it seems that size of unlabeled data is important, maybe even domain ?


New possible features:

POS

previous predictions

prefixes

smaller suffixes/prefixes

generalization of number/date expressions

context elements without certain features

Anyway: 
A script that could perform runs for a number of settings would be helpful

Features: 
Cf. http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp09/hw2.html#svm

Lexical features:
1. The word form (the string as it appears in the sentence)
2. The POS of the word
3. ORT - a feature that captures the orthographic (letter) structure of the word. It
   can have any of the following values: number, contains-digit, contains-hyphen,
   capitalized, all-capitals, URL, punctuation, regular.
4. prefix1: first letter of the word
5. prefix2: first two letters of the word
6. prefix3: first three letters of the word
7. suffix1: last letter of the word
8. suffix2: last two letters of the word
9. suffix3: last three letters of the word

Lookup features:
	gazetters
	similarity
	simstring

context features: 
	-2, -1, 0, 1, 2
