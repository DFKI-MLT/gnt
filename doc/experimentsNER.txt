October, 2015:

- using windowSize=1 hurts !
- using windowSize=3 neutral

- changes in suffix list does not improve either

-> it seems that only dimension around 50 brings something
-> also Turian et al. 2010 only use 50-dims for their word embedding stuff

-> try out better unknown word features

-> Actually, it is unclear, whether GNT feature are usable for NER
-> check again paper from Tkachenko & Simanovsky

New possible features:

POS

previous predictions

prefixes

smaller suffixes/prefixes

generalization of number/date expressions

context elements without certain features

Anyway: 
A script that could perform runs for a number of settings would be helpful

Features: 
Cf. http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp09/hw2.html#svm

Lexical features:
1. The word form (the string as it appears in the sentence)
2. The POS of the word
3. ORT - a feature that captures the orthographic (letter) structure of the word. It
   can have any of the following values: number, contains-digit, contains-hyphen,
   capitalized, all-capitals, URL, punctuation, regular.
4. prefix1: first letter of the word
5. prefix2: first two letters of the word
6. prefix3: first three letters of the word
7. suffix1: last letter of the word
8. suffix2: last two letters of the word
9. suffix3: last three letters of the word

Lookup features:
	gazetters
	similarity
	simstring

context features: 
	-2, -1, 0, 1, 2
