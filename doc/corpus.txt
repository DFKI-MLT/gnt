Corpus used by FLORS:

- training: PTB-3, sec. 2-21 + PTB 1988 WSJ 100.000 unlabeled
	/Users/gune00/data/MLDP/english (conll format of sec. 2-21 of PTB version 3 + extracted sentences)
		- this should give 39,832 sentences -> I have 39,278
		- I think it is, because I am ussing CONLL PTB and comments MLDP/2009/conll09-english/
			"It matches sections 2 through 21 of Treebank. Note that a few sentences from the original 
  			Treebank were removed due to merging problems between the input corpora."
	/Users/gune00/data/BioNLPdata/CoNLL2007/ptb/unlab (tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> only read first 100.000
		-> in FLors, they say that they use the first 100Ksentence from PTB-2
		-> I guess that the corpus above is ok, anyway
	
- test domain 
	/Volumes/data1/sancl-2012/sancl.all -> labeled and unlabeled data (conll format and tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> it is said that unlabeled data has 100T sentences each which is not true
	/Users/gune00/data/BioNLPdata/CoNLL2007/pbiotb (conll format and tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> only read first 100.000
