Corpus used by FLORS:

All data is now in resources/data/ folder.

I am actually only using scancl-2012 data only for ID (In Domain) and OOD (OutOfDomain)

- training: PTB-3, sec. 2-21 + PTB 1988 WSJ 100.000 unlabeled
	I am using the ontonotes-wsj-training.conll file
	
	/Users/gune00/data/BioNLPdata/CoNLL2007/ptb/unlab (tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> only read first 100.000
		-> in FLors, they say that they use the first 100Ksentence from PTB-2
		-> I guess that the corpus above is ok, anyway
	
- test domain 
	/Volumes/data1/sancl-2012/sancl.all -> labeled and unlabeled data (conll format and tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> it is said that unlabeled data has 100T sentences each which is not true
		
	/Users/gune00/data/BioNLPdata/CoNLL2007/pbiotb (conll format and tokenized/sentence/line) 
		-> only read first 100.000

		
Normalization:

- to normalize corpus files run 
	- for all taggerNames corpus.CorpusNormalizer.normalizeAlltaggerNameCorpora()
	- for given taggerName corpus.CorpusNormalizer.normalizeCorpus()
-> both also create copies of the original files
	
- Usually only need to be done one time;
- Same for corpus.CorpusProcessor.processConllFiles()
	- creates sentence files from conll files and also creates proper conll files if necessary

Both can be combined
