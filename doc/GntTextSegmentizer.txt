FEB, 2017:

I have added a GntTextSegmentize class that does:

- tokenization using a reimplementation of the Morphix reader

	- this is a direct implementation of an FST
	- it can recognize German ordinals and cardinals
	
- recognizes abbreviations with simple heuristics

- triggers a sentence boundary flag

- performs sentence splitting

- returns sentence list as list of token lists

TODO:

- improve recognition of special tokens, e.g., numbers, date, abbrevs
	- need better disambiguation etc.
