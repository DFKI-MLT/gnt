NOTES on unlabeled data:

- it is still unclear how the unlabeled data is used in training phase
- so far I understand: all data is used to create distributed word vectors, 
i.e., source domain knowledge and the test domain knowledge
->	so following Blitzer et al (2006): this should merge hidden 
	distributional information from source domain and test domain
->	this is the only place, where I see how unlabeled training data is used
->	THIS MEANS: one could also do testing with fewer test domain knowledge ...

NOTES on unknown words:
-	distributed word vectors are build for each word in a the train and test corpus
-> 	in that sense, word vectors are computed incrementally
-	but what, if a word is totally new ? 
->  currently I build a entry incrementally, which is supported by Flors, cf. page 20, 2nd paragraph
	treating a single word as a sentence consisting of a single word

Online creation of distributed word vectors:
-> can be improved for testing 
	-> testing also involved calling corpus.DistributedWordVectorFactory.sentence2Bigrams(String[])
		but without updating
