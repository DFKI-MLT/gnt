HIERIX:

I have additional NE-conll data
	- improve training so that it can work with many files


apply GntNER on NL and ES conll data
data/conll2002

apply on BioInformatic corpus (as done for SVM)
NLPBA-NER-2004
->
Need to adapt format to conll format

Check features:
add prefixes as features
add POS tags
add phrase clusters
add Jon's clusters


NER lexicons:
	- although I have word clusters, it might be too small
	- so very large NE lists could make sense
	- or retraining of Marmot cluster using own NER relevant data files

HOW to add gazeetteers to GNT 
	- as post processor
	- e.g., correcting assign labels as in with twitter tags?
	- as features like word classes
	
If I want to stick only on supervised data and unsupervised data (clusters, embeddings)
and want to avoid feature engineering, what can I do?
- extract sort of character distribution from labeled data to use as shape features
- used previous tagging decisions to model some sort of grammar
	-> both is considered important also in NN-based NER, cf. /Users/gune00/dfki/DeepLearning/NER/NAACL-2016.pdf
	-> BUT, how can this be done as part of liblinear?
	-> can I use a kind of second layer liblinear approach?
