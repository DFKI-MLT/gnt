November, 2015:

Language setting via taggerName

Where to change:
- define taggerName: DEPOS, DENER
- corpus.Corpus -> ok

-> I think this should work for other languages as well

Now, testing NER and POS
-------------------------

NER:
- conll NER data
- using fr.txt from Clef -> NO, seems to have bad encoding
-> works, and 6,4% F1 (67,7%)  better than SVN-NER
-> but still missing > 10% F-measure

- check encoding -> checked -> using iso-8859-1 when creating conll format
	-> transcode fr.txt from iso to utf-8
	-> NO, I am using Marmots wikipedia sentences
- check shape features for German

POS:
- conll German data: resources/data/german
- Corpus: ok
- ConllMapper: ok
- features.IndicatorWordsCreator -> ok

German Tiger corpus ala Müller et al., 2013
- extract CONLL POS info from tiger2 corpus export format:
- training: first 40,472 sentences -> tiger-train.conll
- development:  next 5000 sentences -> tiger-devel.conll 40,472 + 5000
- testing: last 5000 sentences -> tiger-test.conll 45,472 + 5000

NEXT:
encode numbers as in Müller et al., ACL 2015 -> DONE
-> details in /GNT/doc/corpus.txt
-> NIX bringing, neither for DEPOS nor DENER

What could be done to get better results ? 

NER:
- distributed word vectors -> using de-wikidump sentences -> but I use it currently only for NER
- new cluster models for Marmot -> for NER ?
- shape features for German
- prefixes and suffixes
- mixed 3-gram, 2-grams, 1-grams
- patterns for some suffixes, e.g., numbers

POS:
 
 I have ID=97,30% and OD=91,76% -> best official: ID=97,73% and OD=92,00% -> my OD is already second best!
 
 Call to see POS-individual F1:
 lt-pool-229:resources gune00$ ./conlleval -r < eval/tiger2_devel.txt 


Error analysis: eval/tiger2_devel.txt.debug
- lowest F1:
- 	FM tagged as NE or vice versa -> FM = "fremdsprachliches Material"
- 	PTKANT = "Antwortpartikel" 
	-> occurs two times in devel, in both times wrongly tagged
- 	können VMINF VMFIN, können VMFIN VMINF, sollen VMINF VMFIN, müssen VMFIN VMINF, dürfen VMINF VMFIN
	-> VMINF = "Infinitiv, modal"
- 	an APZR APPR, her APZR ADV, aus APZR APPR, hinaus APZR PTKVZ, an APPR APZR
	-> APZR = "Zirkumposition rechts"
	
- error with tagging of NE and NN:
  NE tagged as NN -> 349 cases
  NN tagged as NE -> 104 cases
 
- XY often as NE: 3 druckreif ADJD XY
2 rtr XY NE
25 HL NE XY
4 B XY NE
5 + XY KON
3 B XY NE
4 + XY KON
5 S XY NE
2 + XY KON
3 S XY NE
11 F XY NE
1 kat XY VAFIN
4 fr XY NE
3 to XY NE
4 sp NE XY
2 whp NE XY
16 B XY NE
11 B. XY NE
2 B XY NE
15 B XY NE
14 B XY NE
2 zba NE XY
1 kna XY NE
7 pid XY NE
5 pid-nie XY PRELS

Current tendency: 

shape features might be important or character-based embeddings ? 1-grams ?
-> I need ako of "letter structure" to recognize foreign or so?
