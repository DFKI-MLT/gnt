October, 2015:

- integration of clusters from /Users/gune00/data/Marmot/Word

- use preprocessed cluster first:

- use cluster name as feature

- create word2clusterID  map

- unknown words are mapped to clusterID of word <RARE>|<Rare>

-> DONE

- how should I represent word-clusterID ?

-> as binary ala shape feature

-> should be able to reuse code of shape

Integration of new feature into system:

- adapt Alphabet -> DONE
	- only few changes necessary
	- add cluster id map and define activation feature
	- DONE
- adapt class Offsets -> DONE
	- insert cluster id offset slot and add to computation
- adapt class WordFeatures
	- insert cluster feature creation and offset computation
	- DONE
- adapt ModelInfo
	- adapt model file name generator
	- DONE
- adapt problemInstance:
	- have to adjust with new clusterID
	- DONE
	
- adapt GNTrainer
	- load cluster data
	- DONE

Seems to be all classes to adapt

-> First tests: worked! and shows improvement for NER of about 4,8% F1

Try them with POS tagger as well -> OK, bring improvements
