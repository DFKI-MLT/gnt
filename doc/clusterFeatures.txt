October, 2015:

- integration of clusters from /Users/gune00/data/Marmot/Word

- use preprocessed cluster first:

- use cluster name as feature

- create word2clusterID  map

- unknown words are mapped to clusterID of word <RARE>|<Rare>

-> DONE

- how should I represent word-clusterID ?

-> as binary ala shape feature

-> should be able to reuse code of shape

Integration of new feature into system:

- as part of Alphabet load new mapping
- adapt class Offsets
- adapt class WordFeatures
