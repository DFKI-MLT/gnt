Possible parameters for experiments:

- dimension of indicator words -> size if distributed feature of words
	- means that distributed word features have to be preprocessed with maxIndicatorWords

- dimension of suffixes

- different suffix sets

- ablation tests on feature sets

- different liblinear classifiers
