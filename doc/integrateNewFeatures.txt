October, 2015:

Integration of new feature into system:

- adapt Alphabet -> DONE
	- only few changes necessary
	- add cluster id map and define activation feature
	- DONE
- adapt class Offsets -> DONE
	- insert cluster id offset slot and add to computation
- adapt class WordFeatures
	- insert cluster feature creation and offset computation
	- DONE
- adapt ModelInfo
	- adapt model file name generator
	- DONE
- adapt problemInstance:
	- have to adjust with new clusterID
	- DONE
	
- adapt GNTrainer
	- load cluster data
	- DONE

This set of classes seems to be all that have to be changed/adapted when a new feature is to be integrated
