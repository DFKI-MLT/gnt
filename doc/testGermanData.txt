November, 2015:

Language setting via taggerName

Where to change:
- define taggerName: DEPOS, DENER
- corpus.Corpus -> ok

-> I think this should work for other languages as well

Now, testing NER and POS
-------------------------

NER:
- conll NER data
- using fr.txt from Clef -> NO, seems to have bad encoding
-> works, and 6,4% F1 (67,7%)  better than SVN-NER
-> but still missing > 10% F-measure

- check encoding -> checked -> using iso-8859-1 when creating conll format
	-> transcode fr.txt from iso to utf-8
	-> NO, I am using Marmots wikipedia sentences
- check shape features for German

POS:
- conll German data: resources/data/german
- Corpus: ok
- ConllMapper: ok
- features.IndicatorWordsCreator -> ok

German Tiger corpus ala Müller et al., 2013
- extract CONLL POS info from tiger2 corpus export format:
- training: first 40,474 sentences -> tiger-train.conll
- development:  next 5000 sentences -> tiger-devel.conll 40,474 + 5000
- testing: last 5000 sentences -> tiger-test.conll 45,474 + 5000

-> done ! corpus.TigerToConllMapper; encoding looks ok
-> now with correct encoding: 0,39 behind SOTA (corrupted: 0,47 behind SOTA)

NEXT:
encode numbers as in Müller et al., ACL 2015 -> DONE
-> NIX bringing, neither for DEPOS nor DENER

What could be done to get better results ? 

POS:
- investe a bit outcome from devel file
	Damit KOUS PROAV
	enthalten ADJD VVPP
	erhalten VVINF VVPP
	
NER:


- distributed word vectors -> using de-wikidump sentences
- shape features for German
- prefixes and suffixes
- mixed 3-gram, 2-grams, 1-grams
- patterns for some suffixes, e.g., numbers
