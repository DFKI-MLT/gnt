November, 2015:

Language as a parameter:

- I can create it via taggerName:
	- currently available: POS and NER
	- add prefix language id
		- DEPOS, DENER
- and then define language specific tagger train/test classes

- Note: shape features are probably language specific

Where to change:
- corpus.Corpus -> ok
- corpus.ConllMapper.main(String[]) -> ok

- features.IndicatorWordsCreator -> ok

- features.WordDistributedFeatureFactory -> nothing
- features.WordShapeFeatureFactory -> nothing
- features.WordSuffixFeatureFactory -> nothing
- features.WordClusterFeatureFactory -> nothing

First NER:
- conll NER data
- using fr.txt from Clef

Then POS:
